                      <li>Obtain a copy of the Terms & Conditions to be used in all invitations and emails to Customer participants, and that your Customer participants will accept when they provide feedback. This should be sent to

                      <li>The Leader of your team should create a Project and assign users to whom you want to give access. (A user is anyone who has an account.)</li>
                      <li>Gather the SMTP details for the “From” email address (e.g., info@yourdomain.com) you will use to send participant Missions. You can get this information from your IT department.</li>

                    <p>NOTE: You will need SMTP technical specifications provided by your IT department. You will also click a button to test the email setup to make sure it works.

                  </ul>
                  <p>This page allows you to view your Touchpoint Map and the collected Mission data (which drives Touchpoint and Action shading and icons). See the next Help section to learn how to Create/ Edit your Map.
                  </p>
				  <p><b>Across the top of the page</b></p>
                  <p>Depending on your Subscription Level, you can toggle between: (a) the Employee Map – with data from Employee and Project Team Missions, or (b) the Customer Map – with data from Customer Missions.</p>
				  <p><b>Drop down selector allows you to choose:</b></p>
                  <ol>
					<li>
					  <b>Show Full Map</b>, This displays the Map with Stages, Touchpoints and Action (without sorting them by Channel). To expand the Map, click on a stage, then all Touchpoints will display. And when you click on a Touchpoint the associated Actions will be displayed.</li>
					<li>
					  <b>Show Actions by Channel</b>. This Map also includes the Stages, Touchpoints and be sorts Actions into rows based on the Channel they were assigned to. Again, to view the Actions associated with each Touchpoint, click on the Touchpoint and its Actions will display. </li>
					<li>
					  <b>View Experience Curve</b>. This Map will display Stages and Touchpoints without Action items. Below the Touchpoints there is an Experience Curve graph that rolls up the data collected in Missions to a Touchpoint level. The line curve displays data collected from Employee and Project Team Missions, while the bars display the data collected from Customer Missions. The curve and bars display is the data from either the Emotion or Value question, depending on what was selected during the Project creation. One Experience Curve will display per Stage on your Map.</li>
					  
				  <p><b>Copy This Map</b></p>  
				  <p>Use this feature to create a copy of your existing map. Clicking this link (on the View Map page), brings you to the page to create a new Project. This is because a new Map (your copy) requires a new Project. In other words, you are simultaneously making a new Project and carrying over the copy of your Map. On the Project page you need to assign a Project Administrator (you will be automatically assigned as the Project Leader) and can make other edits to the new Project.
				  </p>
				  <p>The copy of the Map does not carry over any data collected from Missions. The copy brings over the Stages, Touchpoints and Actions (with Channel assignments).
				  </p>
				  
				  <b>Export Map</b>
                  <p>In Subscription Level 1 you can download a PDF of your complete map (with Channels expanded). Click Export Map from the View Map page. Once the map is downloaded you can control the orientation for printing.
                  </p>
				  
				  
				  <b>To view Mission data</b>
                  <p>Double click on any Action item that was used in a Mission to view the results in 4 tabs:</p>

                      <b>Performance</b>.This shows bar graphs of ratings on the 4 Mission questions (Expectations, Frequency, Value or Emotion, Loyalty).</li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Ratings Comments</b>.Participants are asked "Please tell us why you gave the ratings you did." This tab displays comments by the emotion rating assigned by the Participant.</li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Big Ideas</b>.Participants are asked, "What big ideas do you have for us that would improve your experiences with our company? The bigger the better." This tab will display those comments along with their first name, last initial and date of upload.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Media</b>.Any audio, video, image or document uploads from your Participants are displayed on this page with their first name, last initial and date of upload.

                      <b>Red</b>
                      means the average expectations score ("How well did we meet your expectations on this experience") is between 1 and 2 and the average loyalty score ("How important is this specific experience to earning your loyalty?") is between 4 and 5. This illustrates that we are not meeting expectations for customers who want to be loyal. This is a key area to focus on because you don’t want to lose this audience.

                  <p>To begin, name your Mission and assign a Start Date. The Start Date indicates when your Mission will be sent out. If you want to send it today, choose today’s date. You can also pick a date in the future. This means that in the Send step, the Mission will queue for sending on the Start Date.</p>
                  <p>Assign an End Date. Be sure to leave enough time for Participants to respond to and complete a Mission. Every Mission has the first email invitation to participate, which you write, and then a Reminder Email for Participants who have not yet completed an active Mission. Then click the Save button</p>

				  <p>For each Action item, write instructions for the Participant regarding what part of the Experience you want their feedback on. If you want them to upload Media, write a second set of instructions for that part of the Mission (in the next step) as well. Check the boxes of the Action(s) you want to include, and then click Next.</p>
                  <b>Step 3. Develop your Mission Assignment

                      <b>Media Upload</b>. In this Step you will also decide if you want to include the Media Upload feature as part of your Mission. Use the Media Upload feature if you want to give Participants the option to upload an audio or video recording or upload an image about their experience. If you check the box to include Media Upload in your Mission, you must complete the instructions that appear above the Upload button.
                      <p>Tip: Be very clear about what you want Participants to provide: you can direct them to take photos or record videos of their thoughts or experiences, or upload a screen shot, or whatever will best support your understanding of their experience regarding this particular Action item. Explain to Participants this is an optional field, and that they will have to go create a video, picture or audio file and then upload it here.

                      <p>This email includes two parts automatically. The opening will say "Dear {FirstName}," and below your custom message two links enable them to accept or decline participation in the Mission. One says, "Yes, I’d like to participate." The second says "No, thank you." We will track which link they choose, and we will also track who completes a Mission.</p>

					<p><b>Creating a Project Team Mission</b></p>
					
                    <p>Project Team Participants are those with login access to CX Workout who have been assigned to this CX Project.</p>
					<p>If you have not created a Project Team List previously, click the "Create List" button to display a window with a list of Project Team members.

					<p><b>Creating an Employee or Customer Mission</b></p>
					<p>If you have not created a List previously or want to create a New List, click the “Create List” button to display a window where you can upload an Excel .csv file or manually create a list with first name, last name and email address will appear.</p>
					<p>If you want to upload a file, the Excel file must have 3 columns only. Column A should have a header that says First Name (in cell A1), Column B should have a header that says Last Name (in cell B1) and Column C should have a header that says Email Address (in cell C1). This file must be saved in .csv file format. If your file is 1,000 rows or more, the system may take longer to process the file, so don’t worry if it takes a few moments longer than you might have expected. Any duplicate email address in your uploaded file will be shown below the list data, click the red X next to the one you want to remove from the list. Then click OK to save your list. If any email addresses are incorrectly formatted, they will not be included in the list.</p>
					<p>Once the pop-up window is closed, make sure your new list is selected and click Next. (You can only select and send to one list at a time. You can always copy the Mission and send it out to a second list if desired.)</p>
			
					<b>Step 6. Preview and Send
                    </b>
                    <p>This is where you can see how Participants will view the Mission you created. If you have two Action items, they appear as unique pages on the left side of the screen. You can type in text, move the sliders around on your rating questions, and then click Next or Submit. Since this is a Preview, it will not submit your answers.

                    <font size="3">TIPS: BEFORE YOU SEND</font>
                    <p>When you are ready to send, check the Start Date. Today’s date means the Mission will be sent out shortly after you click Send. A future Start Date means the Mission will be sent out on that date.

                    <p>Make sure your End Date provides enough time for Participants to respond.
                    </p>
                    <p>If it all looks good, click "Send". Your Mission will appear on the Mission page (Project Team, Employee or Customer) based ib what you created. It will say "Live" if it has been sent (you selected today's date as the Start Date), or "Scheduled" if it is set to go out on a future date.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you aren’t ready to Send yet, just leave the page. You can revisit your Draft Mission later and click the Edit button to complete it.

                    <p>Deciding who to invite to be part of a CX Design Team is an important step. Depending on the scope of the project, the type of team membership and length of time they will work on the project will vary. Here are some ideas on the type of roles that are part of a typical Core and Extended CX Design Team to help you decide.</p>
                    <b>CX Workout Core Team</b>:
                    <p>
                      <b>Project Leader</b>: Reporting to the Project Sponsor or Steering Committee, this role is responsible for the overall quality of the project and from Discovery to Deploy. Core Project Team Members report to this person or over the course of the project. For a large, end-to-end design effort, the Project Leader could be a full time resource on the project. In most cases, this is a senior line or functional leader selected to achieve a specific improvement target in the customer experience. (This role is assigned on the CX Projects page.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Project Administrator/Project Manager</b>: This could be a part time or full time role. This person has Project Administrator status inside a Project on the CX Workout Software Platform. The Project Manager oversees all to the details of project management from managing and tracking development of the CX Journey Maps and serves as the Project Leader’s key resource for ensuring the project stays on track. (This role is assigned on the CX Projects page.)</p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Project Support</b>: This role on CX Workout offers a user account level for someone who will access your materials to download and print them. They can export the CX Map and export Reports. These options are defined by your Subscription Level of CX Workout.</p>
                    <b>Core Team Members outside of CX Workout Software Platform:</b>
                    <p>
                      <b>Project Sponsor or Steering Committee</b>: The Project Sponsor or in some cases, Steering Committee provide the Project Leader with an executive(s) who has a vested interested in seeing the project succeed. They may be a senior product, operations or customer service leader with the authority to approve or get the approval for recommendations that will be presented by the CX Design Team.</p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Analysts</b>: Most Design Teams will have at least one Analyst role assigned to the project. This is a person with strong statistical analysis and modeling skills that are most involved with the CX Workout platform once the qualitative data has been collected and you are preparing a Quantitative Survey.</p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Designers</b>: Depending on your business, the Designer role in your organization could be an operations leader, a UX/UI designer, or a marketing expert.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>CX Professionals</b>: This includes anyone in the VOC or CX organization who may be managing the customer satisfaction measurement system or any part of that program.</p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Facilitators</b>: Whether within the Core Team or contracted out, having an experienced facilitator to help conduct Employee meetings or focus groups and the someone to conduct the official CX “Workout” Session is important. (We offer training in the CX Workout methodology used to conduct productive internal sessions based on what has been collected on the Software Platform.)</p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Extended Team</b>: The extended team represents individuals who the Core Team may tap into on an as-need basis but who play an important role nonetheless. These include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Internal Subject Matter Experts</li>

                  <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>Let’s talk about the steps associated with creating a CX Journey Map. Before you get started there are a couple of choices you need to make. The first has to do with who the target customer is your CX Journey Map will represent. Is it your Core Customer or a specific segment of customers? Some companies may represent a customer segment as something called a Persona. A Persona is a human description of a customer segment that brings their preferences, typical demographics and psychographic characteristics to life. Unless your company's experience is focused on primarily one core customer, your marketing team has probably defined two or more customer segments or customer Persona's, that you would typically use as the focus of the experience you plan to map. We suggest creating a CX Journey Map for a specific customer segment. However, if the core experience is the same for different Personas, you can always Label your Customer Actions to be specific to one or more Personas when you are building the Map.</p>
                    <p>The second choice you have to make is around scope. Do you want to map the entire end-to-end customer experience or are you just trying to map one or two Stages? If you are trying to zero in on just the support experience or the customer onboarding experience, then focus your attention on that. You still start out selecting or creating one or more custom Stages and then adding Touchpoints, but be sure to decide how much of the customer experience you plan to map.</p>
                    <p>Our goal with CX Workout is to help you produce a Customer Journey Map that includes all of the salient information in understanding the current customer journey and none of the superfluous things that might be academically interesting, but simply don’t inform an action you would take to create improvements that customers would truly value.
                    </p>
                    <p>We believe this information includes:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Identifying the
                        <b>Stages</b>
                        in the experience. A common set of stages includes the traditional Path to Purchase: Awareness, Research, Purchase, Use and Service. We have developed a set of 7 Stages that include: Hear About; Explore; Commit; Receive; Use; Service and Talk About. These stages describe the major phases that a customer goes through before, during and after purchasing a product or service. With CX Workout you can use the SPCI Stages or create your own but you are limited to no more than 7 stages.
                      </li>
                      <li>Next come
                        <b>Touchpoints</b>. You can think of these as the major Steps in the experience. For example, under the Stage: Hear About, there could be 4 major Touchpoints or Steps: 1. Hear a radio ad, 2. Receive an email invitation to an event, 3. Watch a TV ad or 4. Receive recommendation from a friend. Steps are not necessarily sequential – they can happen in parallel and they may have dependencies or may not. In fact, they may be circular – such as when I get in a bad phone queue and get put on hold or transferred several times.
                      </li>
                      <li>3)The third level of the Journey Map is Customer Actions. These are things that customers are Doing, Thinking or Feeling within the Touchpoint you have described. That is why we use the First Person to describe customer actions such as:
                        <ol type="a">
                          <li>
                            <b>Doing</b>: “I open my browser and search for the company’s website</li>
                          <li>
                            <b>Thinking</b>: “That line looks long, I wonder how much time before I get served?”</li>
                          <li>
                            <b>Feeling</b>:“I love this place - they always make me feel right at home.”</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>One thing to remember, a CX Journey Map is not a Process Map or a Workflow. The goal isn’t to create the engineering diagram of the functional steps, inputs and outputs. That is a good thing to do – but it isn’t the intent of this tool. The CX Journey Map’s purpose is to bring to life the unbiased Functional, Human and Emotional journey that the customer experiences when they buy from your brand. As you describe the Customer Actions, think about what Customers See, Hear, Smell, Taste and Touch throughout the experience. For example, the team at Krispy Kreme doughnuts pipes the smell of fresh doughnut out to the street.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your steps for completing your first CX Journey Map are to:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Define your Stages</li>
                      <li>Define the Touchpoints (or major Steps) associated with each Stage</li>
                      <li>Starting with the first Touchpoint, add the major Customer Actions that occur within that Touchpoint in the First Person: "I click on the Touchpoint and begin adding Actions." Assign a Channel you defined to each Action.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Once you have completed adding all of your Stages, Touchpoints and Actions, you are ready to have either your Core Project Team or even better, a larger group of frontline employees and managers rate the organization’s performance on most or all of the Customer Actions. Emailing to a larger employee base is available for CX Workout Subscription 2 and 3.</p>
